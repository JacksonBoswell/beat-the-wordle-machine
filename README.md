# ai-wordle-solver

> The ai wordle solver uses information theory and statistical entropy to make the best guesses on a random wordle word.

The ai bot and the most optimal guess is based on the expected bit rate of a guess
A word can be the secret word but still not be a wise or optimal guess 
-- this is why a correct answer may be in a low percentile

If a word is sub-optimal, meaning that it is not in the narrowed down word list, the expected bit rate cannot be found
--instead the actual bit rate is used
